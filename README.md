# Big Data Processing (AI60004) - Course Resources

Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹  

I am **Soham Mandal**, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the **Department of Electrical Engineering**, currently pursuing my **Bacholor's in Electrical Engineering** and **Master's in Signal Processing and Machine Learning**.  

This repository contains all the materials I used during the course **Big Data Procseeing (AI60004)**, taught by **Prof. Jiaul Hoque Paik** in the **Spring 2023-24 semester**.  

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a helpful resource for:  
- Students planning to take this course in future semesters.  
- Enthusiasts looking to explore **Big Data Processing/Analytics**.  

Also I have uploaded the programming assignments assigned during the course. Please make sure to check out them to have a more precised understanding of the practical implementations.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ðŸš€  

## Happy Learning! ðŸŽ‰
